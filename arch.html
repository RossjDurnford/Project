        <h2>Tactics and Equipment</h2>
        <p>During this period of time the Greeks had soldiers known as Hoplites. They used a bronze shield
            with a sword and a spear. One specific tactic favoured by the soldiers was the phalanx.
        This was a battle formation that had every soldier cover himself and the man to his left
    with his shield and the depth of the formaiton varied depedning on the commander. This tactic was 
very useful for holding ground in order to not be pushed backwards into a corner. However if they did
need to retreat in order to gain space they would use an Ambuscade. This is where the side being pushed backwards
would fake a retreat in order to lure their enemies into a false sense of security, only to then be ambushed
with another attack they did not see coming.</p>

        <h2>The Battle Of Thermopylae</h2>
        <br>
        <p>This is probably one of the most famous battles in Greek histroy as the story has been 
            told multiple times with modern day movies such as "300". This battle was Greece against 
            what is now known as Iran but at that time was Persia. King Leonidas Lead the defence against
            Xerxes I in the battle of Thermoplae. The battle took place in a narrow coastal pass of 
            Thermoplae. The tactic of the Greeks was to make sure that the Persians could not pass through
            to the main Cities. The Greek forces were in numbers of around 7000, where the Persian forces
            were though to have been at least 15,000 strong. Despite the huge difference in the numbers
            the Greeks were able to hold off the Persian invaders for 7 days which included 3 days of 
            battle. Leonidas and a small number of soldiers held a portion of the pass for two days,
            before they were betrayed by a Greek by the name of Ephialates. This traitor showed the Persians
            an alternative way so they could sandwich the Greeks. It was after this that Leonidas and his troops 
            met their end at the hands of the Persians.
