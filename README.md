# Project 1, Ancient greeks, ReadMe
## Who is this for? 
This website is designed for anyone who wants to learn a little bit about Ancient Greece,
as someone who has a keen interest in History especially the aspects mentioned in the page
I thought it would be a good idea to build a page about this. This page simply informs people
about a few aspects of Ancient Greece  and some customers, wars and their religious system. 
This project was created on gitpod for nothing other than educational purposes.

This information was found on the Code institute IDE and Deployment Essentials.
To deploy this project the steps that i took are as follows:

* Use the code git add followed by the file names
* Once all files are added type "git status" to check the files have been uploaded.
* Once the files are uploaded travel to Git Pages. This is found on the settings tab of the GitHub repository.
