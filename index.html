    <h2>What made the Greeks Different?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The Greeks were in fact very interesting for many reasons,
         one reason being the <em>Olympic Games</em> originated from Ancient Greece. 
         However Greece was the only country involved at this time but the 
         Olympics have been modernised to include the whole world.</p>
         <br>
    <p> The Greeks also had amazing  <em>architectural skills</em>. Some Greek buildings
        whilst ruins are still 
        around today due to the level of skill and perserverance of the Greek people.
         These bulildings mostly are ruins however they have stood for thousands of years.
          A couple of examples of their incredible perseverance include the <em>Parthenon</em> 
          and the <em>Acropolis</em>.</p>
          <br>
    <p><em>Democracy</em> is a Greek concept (who knew?). The Greeks used to have elections and elect their own 
        leaders through a democratic process not to disimillar from what is used in today's
         modern society. They also had a judicial system, the trials were mainly disputes between people and 
        no lawyers would have been present. The punishments would usually fit the crime and the Greeks tried 
    to avoid capital punishment as a deterrent, where instead people would be <em>exiled</em> from their city and 
forced to find an alternative means of living.</p>

        <br>
<p>According to experts, the <em>Parthenon</em> was used as a treasury in Greece after construction 
    in the 5th century B.C. It was also considered the center of religious life in Athens.
    Still standing today it was a display of power, wealth and elevated culture situated in <em>Athens</em>.
